Fortnite FPS but it's 2-D 

# Cloning the repo from VMWare Workstation
Currently this repository is _private_ because I don't want to get slapped with academic offense if someone finds this repo and takes too much inspiration from it. So, cloning is a bit of a pain to do, and sadly we have cannot use GitHub Desktop to interact with the repository because we're using a VM that's purely CLI.

First, you much configure git in your VMWare Workstation by calling:
```
git config --global user.name "your_username"
git config --global user.email your_email@com
```
No quotes when adding email config. After you successfully added the configurations, you should then clone the repo into the `\var\www` folder by calling:
```
git clone https://github.com/elysiayong/2D-not-fortnite.git
```

DM me if something goes wrong/nothing works. (I added you as a collaborator but idk if you need to accept it for you to be able to access my repository).
